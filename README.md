# Hitchcock-fMRI
Script to run Hitchcock movie in scanner

Instructions:

- Ensure BangBang.mov (movie), BangBang.wav (movie sound), and TestClip.wav (sound check bit) are saved within the same folder
- You'll also want to create a folder called "data", as some parameters will be saved when you run the scripts
- Run Hitchock_SoundCheck.psyexp to perform sound check once subject is in the scanner.
- Run Hitchcock_PlayMovie.psyexp before the Movie fmri scan is queued up. You will be able to adjust the volume to 100% or 40% within the script (so, there is only one script).
